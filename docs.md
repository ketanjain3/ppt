## **Glossary**

This glossary defines the key terms and concepts used in the Pipecat framework.

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frame** | The fundamental unit of data or control that flows through a pipeline. Frames can represent audio, images, text, or system signals like `StartFrame` and `EndFrame`. |
| **FrameProcessor** | A modular component that processes frames. It receives frames, performs an action (like transformation, analysis, or aggregation), and pushes new frames upstream or downstream. |
| **Pipeline** | A sequence of linked `FrameProcessor`s that defines the logic of a conversational agent. Frames travel downstream (input to output) and upstream (output to input) through the pipeline. |
| **Transport** | A specialized set of processors that handle the input and output of a pipeline, connecting it to external sources and sinks like WebRTC, WebSockets, or local audio devices. |
| **Service** | A specialized `FrameProcessor` that integrates with an external AI service. Pipecat has three main types: `STTService`, `LLMService`, and `TTSService`. |
| **STTService** | A Speech-to-Text service that consumes `AudioRawFrame`s and produces `TranscriptionFrame`s. |
| **LLMService** | A Large Language Model service that consumes context frames (like `OpenAILLMContextFrame`) and produces `TextFrame`s as a streaming response. |
| **TTSService** | A Text-to-Speech service that consumes `TextFrame`s and produces `TTSAudioRawFrame`s. |
| **PipelineTask** | An object responsible for running a `Pipeline`. It manages the lifecycle, including starting, stopping, and handling frames. |
| **PipelineRunner** | A utility that runs one or more `PipelineTask`s and handles system signals like Ctrl-C for graceful shutdown. |
| **FrameDirection** | The direction a frame is traveling within the pipeline, either `DOWNSTREAM` (e.g., from user input towards bot output) or `UPSTREAM` (e.g., from bot output back towards input). |
| **SystemFrame** | A high-priority frame used for out-of-band control signals (e.g., `StartFrame`, `CancelFrame`, `StartInterruptionFrame`). These frames are processed immediately and are not queued with data frames. |
| **DataFrame** | A frame containing application data, such as audio, text, or images. These frames are processed in order and can be discarded during interruptions. |
| **ControlFrame** | A frame used for in-band control flow, processed in order with data frames (e.g., `EndFrame`, `TTSStoppedFrame`). |
| **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** | The process of detecting human speech in an audio stream. In Pipecat, this is typically handled by a `VADAnalyzer` in the input transport, which generates `UserStartedSpeakingFrame` and `UserStoppedSpeakingFrame`s. |
| **Interruption** | The ability for a user to speak while the bot is talking, causing the bot to stop its current response. This is a core feature for creating natural-feeling conversations and is handled by frames like `StartInterruptionFrame`. |
| **Aggregator** | A type of `FrameProcessor` that collects and combines multiple frames into a single, more meaningful frame. For example, `LLMUserContextAggregator` collects `TranscriptionFrame`s to build a complete user turn. |
| **Observer** | A component that can monitor all frames flowing through the pipeline without being part of the pipeline itself. Useful for logging, debugging, and analytics. |
| **Function Calling (Tools)** | The ability for an `LLMService` to call external functions to retrieve information or perform actions. Pipecat provides a unified format for this using `FunctionSchema` and `ToolsSchema`. |
| **Smart Turn Analyzer** | An advanced processor that uses an ML model to determine if a user has truly finished their conversational turn, going beyond simple silence-based VAD. |
