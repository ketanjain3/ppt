# Pipecat Framework: Introduction

### **Summary of What Pipecat is Used For**

Pipecat is an open-source Python framework for building real-time voice and multimodal conversational agents. It simplifies the orchestration of audio, video, and AI services, allowing developers to create sophisticated applications such as:
- Natural, streaming voice assistants.
- AI companions, coaches, and meeting assistants.
- Multimodal interfaces that process voice, video, and images.
- Interactive business agents for customer intake and support.
- Complex, structured dialog systems.

### **Introduction to Pipecat**

Pipecat is designed to handle the complexities of real-time conversational AI, such as low-latency media streaming, user interruptions, and the integration of various third-party AI services. By providing a composable pipeline architecture, it allows developers to focus on the unique logic of their agent rather than the underlying infrastructure.

#### **Key Benefits**

*   **Voice-First:** Pipecat is built from the ground up for voice interactions, with built-in integrations for speech recognition (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and conversation management.
*   **Pluggable:** The framework supports a wide range of AI services and tools, making it easy to swap components or integrate custom solutions. It includes services for major providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and many others.
*   **Composable Pipelines:** You can build complex agent behavior by linking modular components (`FrameProcessors`) together into a `Pipeline`. This makes the logic easy to understand, modify, and extend.
*   **Real-Time:** Pipecat is optimized for ultra-low latency interaction using transports like WebSockets and WebRTC, enabling natural-feeling conversations with interruption handling.

### **Core Concepts**

Pipecat's architecture is based on a few fundamental concepts that work together to process information in real-time.

*   **Frames:** The basic unit of data or control that flows through the system. A frame can be a chunk of audio, an image, a piece of text, or a control signal like `UserStartedSpeakingFrame`.
*   **FrameProcessors:** Modular components that operate on frames. Each processor consumes a frame, performs an action (e.g., transforms text, calls an AI service, aggregates data), and produces zero or more new frames.
*   **Pipelines:** A chain of linked `FrameProcessors` that defines the flow of data and logic for the agent. Frames travel through the pipeline, being processed at each step.
*   **Transports:** A special type of processor that connects the pipeline to the outside world. Transports handle the input and output of frames from sources like a microphone, a camera, or a WebRTC session.

### **Core Architecture Diagram**

The documentation file `pipecat-main/docs/frame-progress.md` contains a diagram illustrating the core architecture. The diagram shows the flow of a user's voice input through the framework:

1.  A **Transport** receives the user's speech and sends a `TranscriptionFrame` into a **Receive Queue**.
2.  The **Pipeline** pulls the frame and passes it to an **LLM User Message Aggregator**, which updates the **LLM Context**.
3.  The updated context is sent to an **LLM** service, which streams back a text response.
4.  The text is processed by a **TTS** (Text-to-Speech) service, which generates audio.
5.  The audio is sent to a **Send Queue** and finally back to the **Transport** to be played to the user.

### **Key Components**

The Pipecat framework is built from a set of key components that you link together to create your agent.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Transports** | Connect your agent to the user. Examples include `DailyTransport` (for WebRTC calls), `WebsocketServerTransport`, and `LocalAudioTransport` (for local microphone and speakers). |
| **Services** | Specialized processors that integrate with external AI services. The primary types are `STTService` (Speech-to-Text), `LLMService` (Large Language Model), and `TTSService` (Text-to-Speech). |
| **Processors** | General-purpose components that perform tasks like aggregating text into sentences (`SentenceAggregator`), managing conversation history (`LLMUserContextAggregator`), or filtering frames. |
| **Frames** | The data and control signals that flow between processors. Key examples include `AudioRawFrame`, `TranscriptionFrame`, `TextFrame`, and control frames like `UserStartedSpeakingFrame` to manage real-time interaction. |
